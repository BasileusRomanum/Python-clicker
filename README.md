# Python-clicker
A rather simple autoclicer I wrote in python. 
It's supposed to, and does it, to click in random intervals between specified time. 
Wy so? I... really don't know. Friend of mine asked me if I could write him a program, that works this way.

I'd love to add a few more things to it, but it works just well, I think. Failsafe from PyAutoGui is still present and active.
